# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it? 

The gem of my choice is ‘formatador’. I used it to display progress bars for each task/event. It is to give a visual idea of how much of a task is completed at one glance. 

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1
This feature allows one to delete multiple items off the items array. 
  b) Feature 2
Feature 2 allows one to change the due date on the task/event. 

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spend about 10 days, 6 hours per day working on this project. 

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge will have to be incorporating the gem into this project. I spent a lot of time figuring out how to do so. 

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
The two additional features were to allow user to change the due date or to delete multiple items off the items array. When a task is completed or an event has passed, one should be able to update the list, delete items and reduce clutter. I think change of due date is necessary because there can be a scenario that the user cannot finish the task on time due to unforeseen delays or other pressing priorities that needs to be completed first.

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
With knowledge of ruby gems has taken my learning to another level and i think there is plenty to learn and explore here.
